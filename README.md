# WWDC-2015-Scholarship-Application

My application submitted for the WWDC 2015 student scholarship. My submission was accepted and I was awarded with a free WWDC 2015 ticket.

The application tries to create a new method of navigating through the app by creating one big "space" which the user can swipe around as the application snaps to each section of the application. A pinch gesture can be used to zoom out and view an overview of the application. The code is not pretty not elegant, but it does the job!
